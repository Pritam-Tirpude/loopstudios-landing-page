## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (Syntactically awesome stylesheets)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

Buliding this project was awesome :smiley: use of both the `Flexbox` and `Grid` makes this project interesting and coding the mobile menu is just amazing. You can build the array of images section by using `Flexbox` only but try using grid make your hands litlle dirty by using `Grid` and understand this layout on how it works and find out where we can implement `Grid` and when it is necessary. I think `Grid` is needed only for specfic sections that we want to display as a `Grid`.

Feel free :cowboy_hat_face: to checkout the code and see what you can learn. :+1::thumbsup:
